<p>Q: What is Volume Gateway?</p>

<p>A: Volume Gateway provides an iSCSI target, which enables you to create block storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises or EC2 application servers. The Volume Gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode.</p>

<p>In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.
In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.
In either mode, you can take point-in-time snapshots of your volumes, which are stored as Amazon EBS Snapshots in AWS, enabling you to make space-efficient versioned copies of your volumes for data protection, recovery, migration and various other copy data needs.</p>

Which of the following would enable the Solutions Architect to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)
A. An Aurora instance as the primary database with a read replica in the DR region.
B. Inter-region VPC peering between the primary workload VPC and the DR VPC
C. A cross-region Amazon EC2 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) copy
D. Amazon S3 cross-region replication of application-tier installers
E. Amazon CloudWatch Events in the primary region that trigger the failover to the DR region</p>

<p>A Solutions Architect is creating a multi-tiered architecture for an application that includes a public-facing web tier. Security requirements state that the Amazon
EC2 instances running in the application tier must not be accessible directly from the internet.
What should be done to accomplish this?
A. Create a multi-VPC peering mesh with network access rules limiting communications to specific ports. Implement an internet gateway on each VPC for external connectivity.
B. Place all instances in a single Amazon VPC with AWS WAF as the web front-end communication conduit. Configure a NAT gateway for external communications.
C. Use VPC peering to peer with on-premises hardware. Direct enterprise traffic through the VPC peer connection to the instances hosted in the private VPC.
D. Deploy the web and application instances in a private subnet. Provision an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet. Install an internet gateway and use security groups to control communications between the layers.</p>

<p>A Lambda function must execute a query against an Amazon RDS database in a private subnet.
Which steps are required to allow the Lambda function to access the Amazon RDS database? (Select two.)</p>

<p>A. Create a VPC Endpoint for Amazon RDS.
B. Create the Lambda function within the Amazon RDS VPC.
C. Change the ingress rules of Lambda security group, allowing the Amazon RDS security group.
D. Change the ingress rules of the Amazon RDS security group, allowing the Lambda security group.
E. Add an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC, route the private subnet to the IGW.</p>
