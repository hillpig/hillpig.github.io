# Case styles

In English, a variety of case styles are used in various circumstances:

1. Sentence case

    > The vitamins are in my fresh California raisins

2. Title case (capital case, headline style)

    > The Vitamins Are in My Fresh California Raisins

3. All caps (all uppercase)

    > THE VITAMINS ARE IN MY FRESH CALIFORNIA RAISINS

4. All lowercase

    > the vitamins are in my fresh california raisins

# Special case styles

1. Camel case

    > theQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog

2. Pascal case

    > TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog

3. Snake case

    > the_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog

4. Kebab case

    > the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog

5. Studly caps

    > tHeqUicKBrOWnFoXJUmpsoVeRThElAzydOG

    Mixed case with no semantic or syntactic significance to the use of the capitals. Sometimes only vowels are upper case, at other times upper and lower case are alternated, but often it is simply random. The name comes from the sarcastic or ironic implication that it was used in an attempt by the writer to convey their own coolness. It is also used to mock the violation of standard English case conventions by marketers in the naming of computer software packages, even when there is no technical requirement to do so – e.g., Sun Microsystems' naming of a windowing system NeWS. Illustrative naming of the style is, naturally, random: stUdlY cAps, StUdLy CaPs, etc.
