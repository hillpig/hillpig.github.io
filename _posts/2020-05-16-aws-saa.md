## Amazon Redshift database encryption

- You can enable encryption when you launch your cluster, or you can modify an unencrypted cluster to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption. To do so, you can use either an AWS-managed key or a customer-managed key (CMK). When you modify your cluster to enable KMS encryption, Amazon Redshift automatically migrates your data to a new encrypted cluster. Snapshots created from the encrypted cluster are also encrypted. You can also migrate an encrypted cluster to an unencrypted cluster by modifying the cluster and changing the Encrypt database option.

## AWS Storage Gateway modes

Q: What is Volume Gateway?

A: Volume Gateway provides an iSCSI target, which enables you to create block storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises or EC2 application servers. The Volume Gateway runs in either a cached or stored mode.

In the cached mode, your primary data is written to S3, while retaining your frequently accessed data locally in a cache for low-latency access.
In the stored mode, your primary data is stored locally and your entire dataset is available for low-latency access while asynchronously backed up to AWS.
In either mode, you can take point-in-time snapshots of your volumes, which are stored as Amazon EBS Snapshots in AWS, enabling you to make space-efficient versioned copies of your volumes for data protection, recovery, migration and various other copy data needs.

B. Replace all On-Demand Instances with Spot Instances in the Auto Scaling group.
