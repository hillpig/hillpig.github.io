**Example**

   My neighbor is a good man but he can be **moody** and has a bad **temper**. To make things worse, I’m quite an **emotional** person so I go through a range of **emotions** throughout the day. The other day, I saw my neighbor in his garden.  “Good morning,” I said cheerfully. He stared at me, clearly in no **mood** to chat. “What’s so good about it?” he yelled back angrily, losing his **temper**. Overcome by **emotion**, I burst into tears and ran back into our house. The whole thing really put me in a bad **mood** for the rest of the day.

  
   我的鄰居人不錯，但他**喜怒無常**，而且**脾氣**不好。更糟的是，我是個感情豐富的人，也就是說我在短短一天內可以表現出一系列不同的**情感**。一天，我看鄰居在他家花園裡，便開心地對他說：“早上好。” 當時他直勾勾地盯著我，顯然沒**心情**聊天，衝我嚷道：“哪裡好了？” 接著竟衝我**發起火來**。被**情緒**所左右的我一下子就哭了，然後跑回了家裡。那件事影響了我一整天的**心情**。
