<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>My neighbor is a good man but he can be <strong>moody</strong> and has a bad <strong>temper</strong>. To make things worse, I’m quite an <strong>emotional</strong> person so I go through a range of <strong>emotions</strong> throughout the day. The other day, I saw my neighbor in his garden.  “Good morning,” I said cheerfully. He stared at me, clearly in no <strong>mood</strong> to chat. “What’s so good about it?” he yelled back angrily, losing his <strong>temper</strong>. Overcome by <strong>emotion</strong>, I burst into tears and ran back into our house. The whole thing really put me in a bad <strong>mood</strong> for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>我的鄰居人不錯，但他<strong>喜怒無常</strong>，而且<strong>脾氣</strong>不好。更糟的是，我是個感情豐富的人，也就是說我在短短一天內可以表現出一系列不同的<strong>情感</strong>。一天，我看鄰居在他家花園裡，便開心地對他說：“早上好。” 當時他直勾勾地盯著我，顯然沒<strong>心情</strong>聊天，衝我嚷道：“哪裡好了？” 接著竟衝我<strong>發起火來</strong>。被<strong>情緒</strong>所左右的我一下子就哭了，然後跑回了家裡。那件事影響了我一整天的<strong>心情</strong>。</p>
