<p>Dear all, I am jack wey, this above mentioned email for marketing is only one sample to your general potential clients, it would be revised accordingly to different clients.
Kindly be informed that email marketing is mainly depending on your SET title, therefore pls try to improve TO SET THE TITLE OF YOUR EMAIL.</p>

<p>（开发信的成功与否，跟开发信内容的大少无关，关键是你怎么把涉及到客户每一个利益、兴趣都说到，能连起来，他都会像继续看下去，要不我们还看电视连续剧干嘛？)
邮件开发成功与否与以下几个方面有关（个人认为）：（按主次顺序）</p>
<ol>
  <li>邮件标题（要是我，邮件标题一看就知道是推销的，I am sorry, please fuck off and stay in my trash box）</li>
  <li>邮件内容是否吸引/对客户是否有效，有利可图；客户是否感兴趣.</li>
  <li>所联系的人的职位和权利（Pls send to the RIGHT PERSON）</li>
  <li>发信人日后沟通技巧，plus</li>
  <li>others</li>
</ol>

<p>以上的开发信只是针对任意一家公司，如果要想开发信更成功，你就得研究或者了解一下这个公司的情况再发。</p>

<p>有的开发信中，并不能把所有东西都一一列出来，所以一天发个100封的开发信的人，一天很难记下前天发给谁了，日后很难去跟踪，也不知道自己以前说了什么，如果是这样，最好做个记录；邮件已发出3天之内，马上再发一封邮件跟踪，过2如没有回复，再发一封了解，第三封邮件刚发后30分钟，马上给个电话。</p>

<p>记住，成功的开发信，一般要有电话跟踪才能比较有效果，当然有幸运的人，或是客户也正好有询价，有货采购才会直接跟你联系，所以为什么要日后电话沟通的原因。现在一般一个客户一天能收到很多信，你只有电话过去了，说明你请况，他才知道你是谁，什么公司，下次在电话的时候，他会说“oh, Jack? Jack wey from China,XXX company? Oh, how are you? …..”.</p>

<p>借引荐建立业务关系
At the beginning of this month , I attended the Harrogate toy fair. While there, I had an interesting conversation with Mr. Douglas Gage of Edutoys plc about selecting an agency for our teaching aids. Douglas described your dynamic sales force and innovative approach to marketing. He attributed his own company’s success to your excellent distribution network that has served him for several years. We need an organization like yours to launch our products in the UK. Our teaching aids cover the whole field of primary education in all subjects .Our patented ‘Matrix’ math apparatus is particularly successful. You may have reservations about American teaching aids suiting your market. This is not a problem since we have complete range of British English versions. I enclose an illustrated catalogue of our British English editions for your information. Please let me have your reactions to the material. I shall be in London during the first two weeks of October. Perhaps we could arrange a meeting to discuss our proposal.

We very much hope that we can resume our mutually beneficial relationship now that peace has returned to Lebanon. Since we last traded, our lines have changed beyond recognition.

<p>请求客户作推荐人
Thank you for your letter of 2 November. We are delighted to hear that you are to please with the refurbishment of your hotel. As your know .in our line of work, we depend on good, reports about our projects to win further business. Our clients always shop around and look for references before committing themselves. With your permission, we would like to use your hotel as a reference when we discuss similar refurbishments in the hotel industry.

We would, of course, stay overnight at least. I’ll call you next week to hear your reaction.

<p>通知客户价格调整
We enclose our new catalogue and price list. The revised prices will apply from 1 April 1997. You will see that there have been number of changes in our product range. A number of improved models have been introduced. Out range of washing machines has been completely revamped. Many popular lines, however, have been retained unchanged. You will be aware that inflation is affecting industry as a whole .Ws have been affected like everyone else and some price increases have been unavoidable. We have not, however, increased our prices across the board, In many cases, there is a small price increase, but in others, none at all. We can assure you that the quality of our consumer durables has been maintained at a high standard and that our service will continue to be first class. We look forward to receiving your orders. 谨谢上新的商品目录和价格表。修订价格定于1997年4月1日起生效。产品系列有一大革新，增加了不少改良的型号，扒出一系列新款的洗衣机，但许多款的开动号仍保持不变。通货膨胀影响整个工业连带令货品价格上涨。虽然如此，本公司并未全面提升价格，调整幅度亦不大。 本公司坚守一贯信念，务求出产优质之耐用消费品，迎合顾客的需要。 谢谢贵公司多年惠顾，盼继续合作。</p>

<p>说明价格调整原因
I enclose our new price list, which will come into effect, from the end of this month. You will see that we have increased our prices on most models. We have, however, refrained from doing so on some models of which we hold large stocks. We feel we should explain why we have increased our prices. We are paying 10% more for our raw materials than we were paying last year. Some of our subcontractors have risen there by as much as 15%. As you know, we take great pride in our machines and are jealous of the reputation for quality and dependability that we have achieved over the last 40 years. We will not compromise that reputation because of rising costs. We hope, therefore decided to raise the price of some of our machines. We hope you will understand our position and look forward to your orders. 现谨附上本公司新价格表，新价格将于本月底生效。除了存货充裕的商品外，其余大部分货品均已调升价格。是次调整原因是原材料价格升幅上涨10%，一些承包商的价格调升到15%。 过去40年，本公司生产的机器品质优良、性能可靠。今为确保产品质量，唯有稍为调整价格。上述情况，还望考虑。愿能与贵公司保持紧密合作。</p>

<p>应付难办的客户
We have been doing business together for a long time and we value our relationship of late, we have not been able to provide the kind of service we both want. The problem is that your purchasing department is changing orders after they have been placed. This has led to confusion and frustration for both of our companies. In several instances, you have returned goods that were originally ordered. To solve the problem, I propose that on receipt of an order, our sales staff contact you to verify it. If you decide on any changes, we will amend the order and fax you a copy so that you can check it. I trust this system will cut down on delays and errors, and allow our operations to run smoothly. 承蒙多年惠顾，本公司感激万分。然近来合作出现问题，令服务水准未能符合对方要求，本公司为此提忧不已。 贵公司采部发出定单后，再三更改内容；更有甚者，屡次退回订购之货品，导致了双方公司工作中的混乱和困惑。为避免问题日趋严重，特此在接到定单后，由本公司销售人员与贵公司复核。若需作出改支，本公司把定单修改后电传副本，供贵公司查核。 盼望上述办法经受减少延误，促进双方业务发展。</p>

<p>祝贺新公司成立

Please let us know if we can be of any assistance to you. We will be delighted to help. We wish you the very best of luck and a prosperous future.</p>

<p>修改信用证
Dear Mr. Jones:
We have received your L/C No.121/99 issued by the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development for the amount of $19,720 covering 1,600 dozen Men’s Shirts. After reviewing the L/C, we find that transshipment and partial shipment are not allowed.
As direct steamers to your port are difficult to find, we have to ship via Hong Kong more often than not. As to partial shipment, it would be our mutual benefit because we could ship immediately whatever we have on hand instead waiting for the whole lot to be completed.
We, therefore, are writing this afternoon, asking you to amend the L/C to read: “TRANSSHIPMENT AND PARTIALSHIPMENT ALLOWED”
We shall be glad if you see to it that amendment is cabled without any delay, as our goods have been packed ready for shipment for quite some time.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>延期信用证的期限
Dear Mr. Jones:
We thank you for your L/C for the captioned goods. We are sorry that owing to some delay on the part of our suppliers at the point of origin, we are not able to get the goods ready before the end of this month. As a result, we sent you a cable yesterday reading: L/C1415 PLSCABLE EXTENSION SHIPMENT VALIDITY 15/31 MAY RESPECTIVELY LETFOLLOWS
It is expected that the consignment will be ready for shipment in the early part of May and we are arranging to ship it on s/s “Fanyang” sailing from Dalian on or about 10th May.
We are looking forward to receiving your cable extension of the above L/C thus enabling us to effect shipment of the goods in question.
We thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>拒绝对方做独家代理商的要求
Dear Mr. Jones:
Thank you for your letter of 15th September.
As we are now only at the get-acquainted stage, we feel it is too early to take into consideration the matter of sole agency. In our opinion, it would be better for both of us to try out a period of cooperation to see how things go. Also, it would be necessary for you to test the marketability of our products at your end and to continue your efforts in building a larger turnover to justify the sole agency arrangement.
We enclose our latest pricelist covering all the products we handle within the framework of your specialized lines.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>指定对方为独家代理商
Dear Mr. Jones:
We have received your letter of the 15th and are impressed with the proposal you make. We are pleased to tell you that we have decided to entrust you with the sole agency for our Embroideries in the territory of Sweden.
The Agency Agreement has been drawn up for a duration of one year, automatically renewable on expiration for a similar period unless a written notice is given to the contrary. Enclosed you will find a copy of the draft. Please go over the provisions and advise us whether they meet with your approval.
We shall do all in our power to assist you in establishing a mutually beneficial trade.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>处理对货损的投诉
Dear Mr. Jones:
We have received your letter of 18th July, informing us that the sewing machines we shipped to you arrived in a damaged condition on account of imperfectness of our packing.
Upon receipt of your letter, we have given this matter our immediate attention. We have studied your surveyor’s report very carefully.
We are convinced that the present damage was due to extraordinary circumstances under which they were transported to you. We are therefore not responsible for the damage; but as we do not think that it would be fair to have you bear the loss alone, we suggest that the loss be divided between both of us, to which we hope you will agree.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>处理对货物品质的投诉
Dear Mr. Jones:
We very much regret to learn form your letter of 2nd March that you are not satisfied with the dress materials supplied to your order No.9578
From what you say it seems possible that some mistakes has been made in our selection of the materials meant for you and we are arranging for our Mr. Yang to call on you later this week to compare the materials supplied with the samples form which your ordered them.
If it is found that our selection faulty, then you can most certainly rely on us to replace the materials. In any case, we are willing to take the materials back and, if we can not supply what you want, to cancel your order, though do this reluctantly since we have no wish to lose your custom.

<p>作为对方供应商，认为对方压价太低</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Jones:
We confirm having received your telex No.LT/531 of May 17, asking us to make a 10% reduction in our price for Men’s Shirts. Much to our regret, we are unable to comply with your request because we have given you the lowest possible price. We can assure you that the price quoted reflects the high quality of the products.
We still hope to have the opportunity to work with you and any further enquiry will receive our prompt attention.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>作为买家，认为对方报价太高
Dear Mr. Jones,
We acknowledge receipt of both your offer of May 6 and the samples of Men’s Shirts, and thank you for these.
While appreciating the good quality of your shirts, we find your price is rather too high for the market we wish to supply.
We have also to point out that the Men’s Shirts are available in our market from several European manufacturers, all of them are at prices from 10% to 15% below the price you quoted.
Such being the case, we have to ask you to consider if you can make reduction in your price, say 10%. As our order would be worth around US$50,000, you may think it worthwhile to make a concession.
We are looking forward to your reply,
Sincerely,</p>

<p>要求对方开立信用证
Dear Mr. Jones:
With reference to the 4,000 dozen shirts under our Sales Confirmation No.SX260, we wish to draw your attention to the fact that the date of delivery is approaching but up to the present we have not received the covering L/C. Please do you utmost to expedite its establishment so that we may execute the order within the prescribed time.
In order to avoid subsequent amendments, please see to it that the L/C stipulations are in exact accordance with the terms of the contract.
We look forward to receiving your favorable response at an early date.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>因对方未能如期信用证而交涉
Dear Mr. Jones:
With reference to our Sales Confirmation No.825 dated August 10, 2002, we regret to say that your letter of credit has not yet reached us up to the time of writing. This has caused us much inconvenience as we have already made preparations for shipment according to the stipulations of the said Sales Confirmation.
You must be aware that the terms and conditions of a contract once signed should be strictly observed, failure to abide by them will mean violation of contract. If you refer to our Sales Confirmation, you will see the clause reading:
“The Buyer shall establish the covering Letter of Credit before 30th August, 2002, failing which the Seller reserves the right to rescind the contract without further notice.”
The goods you ordered have been ready for quite some time and the demand of late has been so great that we find it hard to keep them for you any longer. However, in consideration of our friendly business relations, we are prepared to wait for your L/C, which must reach us not later than October 5, 2002. If we again fail to receive your L/C in time, we shall cancel our Sales Confirmation and ask you to refund to us the storage charges we have paid on your behalf.
Your cooperation in this respect will be appreciated.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>修改信用证
Dear Mr. Jones:
We have received your L/C No.121/99 issued by the Yemen Bank for Reconstruction &amp; Development for the amount of $19,720 covering 1,600 dozen Men’s Shirts. After reviewing the L/C, we find that transshipment and partial shipment are not allowed.
As direct steamers to your port are difficult to find, we have to ship via Hong Kong more often than not. As to partial shipment, it would be our mutual benefit because we could ship immediately whatever we have on hand instead waiting for the whole lot to be completed.
We, therefore, are writing this afternoon, asking you to amend the L/C to read: “TRANSSHIPMENT AND PARTIALSHIPMENT ALLOWED”
We shall be glad if you see to it that amendment is cabled without any delay, as our goods have been packed ready for shipment for quite some time.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>延期信用证的期限
Dear Mr. Jones:
We thank you for your L/C for the captioned goods. We are sorry that owing to some delay on the part of our suppliers at the point of origin, we are not able to get the goods ready before the end of this month. As a result, we sent you a cable yesterday reading: L/C1415 PLSCABLE EXTENSION SHIPMENT VALIDITY 15/31 MAY RESPECTIVELY LETFOLLOWS
It is expected that the consignment will be ready for shipment in the early part of May and we are arranging to ship it on s/s “Fanyang” sailing from Dalian on or about 10th May.
We are looking forward to receiving your cable extension of the above L/C thus enabling us to effect shipment of the goods in question.
We thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>拒绝对方做独家代理商的要求
Dear Mr. Jones:
Thank you for your letter of 15th September.
As we are now only at the get-acquainted stage, we feel it is too early to take into consideration the matter of sole agency. In our opinion, it would be better for both of us to try out a period of cooperation to see how things go. Also, it would be necessary for you to test the marketability of our products at your end and to continue your efforts in building a larger turnover to justify the sole agency arrangement.
We enclose our latest pricelist covering all the products we handle within the framework of your specialized lines.
We look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>指定对方为独家代理商
Dear Mr. Jones:
We have received your letter of the 15th and are impressed with the proposal you make. We are pleased to tell you that we have decided to entrust you with the sole agency for our Embroideries in the territory of Sweden.
The Agency Agreement has been drawn up for a duration of one year, automatically renewable on expiration for a similar period unless a written notice is given to the contrary. Enclosed you will find a copy of the draft. Please go over the provisions and advise us whether they meet with your approval.
We shall do all in our power to assist you in establishing a mutually beneficial trade.
Sincerely,</p>

<p>处理对货损的投诉
Dear Mr. Jones:
We have received your letter of 18th July, informing us that the sewing machines we shipped to you arrived in a damaged condition on account of imperfectness of our packing.
Upon receipt of your letter, we have given this matter our immediate attention. We have studied your surveyor’s report very carefully.
We are convinced that the present damage was due to extraordinary circumstances under which they were transported to you. We are therefore not responsible for the damage; but as we do not think that it would be fair to have you bear the loss alone, we suggest that the loss be divided between both of us, to which we hope you will agree.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>温馨提示
为了帮助大家提高外贸邮件送达率和转化率，本人温馨提示，在发送外贸邮件的时候，需要注意一下几点：</p>
<ol>
  <li>非常简洁明了的标题</li>
  <li>语言要简洁，多用短句, 长句一定要分拆为短句，哪怕多写几句</li>
  <li>语气要委婉 ，不要用 YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU SHOULD, YOU MUST这类，也不要说什么YOUR ORDER IS TOO SMALL，换种语气，会非常好</li>
  <li>多用被动语态       真正的老美写邮件是很少 用 WE, I 之类的第一人称，通常都是用被动 比如，I WILL INFORM YOU TRACKING NO. SOON.  老美会写，THE TRACKING NO. WILL BE SUPPLIED SOON</li>
  <li>段落之间的逻辑关系一定要清晰</li>
  <li>有选择的情况下，不要用陈述句，要用 选择句型   比如外贸人常用的 our price is XXX for 2000 pcs but it is XXX for 3000 pcs Do you want to buy 2000 pcs or 3000 pcs?
      另外，就是在要提出解决办法的时候，一定要用 1, 2 , 3…. 简洁明白的说出来，然后让客户选择，或者提问  What is your idea or solution?</li>
  <li>注意中式英语，很多都是习惯问题，我们自己看的很明白，很清楚，但是，老外就很难看懂。</li>
  <li>
    <p>如果发送量比较大，建议采用第三方专业邮件营销服务提供商来发送。 我这里推荐一家公司的软件。Comm100邮件营销软件，我一个月前开始使用他们的产品的。总的来说，他们的软件，操作蛮方便的，不需要注册大量邮箱，发送量也没有限制；送达率也比较高，我几次下来，都能达到92%以上；另外本人最喜欢的功能是统计功能比较强大，可以清楚的知道谁收到邮件，谁点击了邮件中链接。他们的网站是：http://www.comm100.cn/emailmarketingnewsletter/
有兴趣的童鞋，可以去试用一下。</p>
  </li>
  <li>注意邮件里面的字体一直，颜色等问题  一般老外都用 ARIAL 这个字体。</li>
  <li>称呼  有的人喜欢用 hi my brother, hi boss, hi manager, dear  sir 等等，这些不要所有的客户都用一种，要根据客户的反应来称呼，通常要客户保持一致，或者要根据客户的年龄，性格等等去区分，不能简单的就将所有的客户用同一个称呼。 有的客户是BOSS, 有的是MANAGER, 有的只是一般采购代表。在国外公司的邮件都是有监控系统的。在没有搞清对方身份或者爱好前，乱称呼是有风险的。</li>
  <li>注意多用详细的数据，比如多少数量，多少箱，多重，多少钱，PI号码，多少天数 等等，这类信息都是非常重要。</li>
  <li>多用感谢的话，多用问候，结尾不要一成不变地是 HAVE A NICE DAY BEST REGARDS
可以这样写：
祝你今天过得非常愉快
祝你有一个美好的一天
周末愉快
祝你有个好心情
祝贺你今天撞大运
……</li>
  <li>针对客户的邮件多问客户一些问题，多用 WHAT DO YOU THINK?  WHAT IS YOUR IDEA?</li>
  <li>多跟客户套近乎          黏住一个客户是非常重要的事情，所以怎样跟客户做成朋友就非常关键了。这里，外贸行业有一个说法：不会跟客户谈“恋爱”的业务一定做不成一个好业务。所以，做外贸，常常也是在跟 自己的产品谈恋爱，跟客户谈恋爱。</li>
  <li>节日的问候，圣诞节一定要给客户发电子贺卡。平时其他一些重大节日也要问候客户。</li>
  <li>发生重大事件跟客户交流想法，比如 冰岛火山，地震，海啸，也要及时问候当地的客户。</li>
  <li>我们自己公司的放假通知一定要提前传达给客户。</li>
  <li>用心写好每一封邮件         这点是最难做到的，很多人都是忽视了这点。</li>
</ol>
