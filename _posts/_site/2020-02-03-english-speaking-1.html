<p>M: Hey Rachel, how are you?</p>

<p>W: I’m good but I’m a bit nervous.</p>

<p>M: Why?</p>

<p>W: Because I’m starting at a new company in a couple of days, but I don’t really know know to introduce myself to a new group of people.</p>

<p>M: The first day at a company is nerve-racking, right?</p>

<p>You meet so many new faces and they all know each other as well. That is evven worse. But there are some things you should do on your first day.</p>

<p>W: I’d love some advice.</p>

<p>Note: 
    nerve-racking: stressful, exhausting</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>new faces: new people
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>M: Ok. A firm handshake, that is key, to project confidence, but not too hard, you don’t want to hurt the other person, but not to flimsy as well. I hate a wet flimsy handshake. So if you are feeling nervous and sweaty, perhaps give your hand a wipe as well.</p>

<p>Note:
    project: to give or express a clear impression of one’s thoughts or personality; make an image</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>flimsy: weak, without strength, unstable
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>W: Clammy hands.</p>

<p>M: They are going to call you clammy hands at the company.</p>

<p>W: Alright, so a firm handshake is really important.</p>

<p>M: And then eye contact as well.</p>

<p>Note:
    clammy: cold and damp, covered with moisture; wet, sweaty</p>

<p>M: And a big smile, I think that always helps, it makes people feel much more comfortable.</p>

<p>W: Yeah that’s true, that definitely will leave a great first impression.</p>

<p>M: As long as you don’t have something stuck in your teeth. Again, check.</p>

<p>Note:
    to leave an impression (on someone): to provide a lasting memory for someone</p>

<p>W: I’ll have to get a mirror and check my teeth. That’s for sure. Alright so you’re saying a firm handshake is important, good eye contact, those show that I’m confident and then a friendly smile will show that I’m at ease and that I’m confortable with my surroundings.</p>

<p>M: Sure, and then maybe the last thing remember people’s names.</p>

<p>W: Oh, right!</p>

<p>M: And when you say your name as well, project it loudly so they remember you.</p>

<p>W: But you know, there’s so many people that I have to meet. How do I remember all their names?</p>

<p>M: I think writing it down as soon as you can, at the earliest possible opportunity. But I think that’s about it. And I think you’ll be fine, Rachel.</p>

<p>W: You think so? Alright, well I can’t wait to use that advice on my first day at my new company.</p>

<p>M: Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>W: Thank you.</p>

<p>Note:
    keep one’s fingers crossed: to wish someone luck; to hope for a good outcome for someone</p>
