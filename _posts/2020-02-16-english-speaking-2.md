M: Hey Rachel, how are you?

W: I'm good but I'm a bit nervous.

M: Why?

W: Because I'm starting at a new company in a couple of days, but I don't really know know to introduce myself to a new group of people.

M: The first day at a company is nerve-racking, right?

   You meet so many new faces and they all know each other as well. That is evven worse. But there are some things you should do on your first day.

W: I'd love some advice.

Note: 

    nerve-racking: stressful, exhausting

    new faces: new people

M: Ok. A firm handshake, that is key, to project confidence, but not too hard, you don't want to hurt the other person, but not to flimsy as well. I hate a wet flimsy handshake. So if you are feeling nervous and sweaty, perhaps give your hand a wipe as well.

Note:

    project: to give or express a clear impression of one's thoughts or personality; make an image

    flimsy: weak, without strength, unstable

W: Clammy hands.

M: They are going to call you clammy hands at the company.

W: Alright, so a firm handshake is really important.

M: And then eye contact as well.

Note:

    clammy: cold and damp, covered with moisture; wet, sweaty

M: And a big smile, I think that always helps, it makes people feel much more comfortable.

W: Yeah that's true, that definitely will leave a great first impression.

M: As long as you don't have something stuck in your teeth. Again, check.

Note:

    to leave an impression (on someone): to provide a lasting memory for someone

W: I'll have to get a mirror and check my teeth. That's for sure. Alright so you're saying a firm handshake is important, good eye contact, those show that I'm confident and then a friendly smile will show that I'm at ease and that I'm confortable with my surroundings.

M: Sure, and then maybe the last thing remember people's names.

W: Oh, right!

M: And when you say your name as well, project it loudly so they remember you.

W: But you know, there's so many people that I have to meet. How do I remember all their names?

M: I think writing it down as soon as you can, at the earliest possible opportunity. But I think that's about it. And I think you'll be fine, Rachel.

W: You think so? Alright, well I can't wait to use that advice on my first day at my new company.

M: Fingers crossed.

W: Thank you.

Note:

    keep one's fingers crossed: to wish someone luck; to hope for a good outcome for someone
